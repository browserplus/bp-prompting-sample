This repo can be used to build the BrowserPlus prompting sample service.
A very simple sample Ruby BrowserPlus service that demonstrates the
undocumented (at time of writing) ability to render custom HTML
prompts from within services.

This service uses submodules browserplus/bakery, and browserplus/bp-service-framework.
 
Instructions to build the service are in the file BUILDING.
